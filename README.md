Search Tracks on iTunes

Built on Xcode 12.4 Swift 5 Cocoapods 1.9.1

Make sure to run a `Pod Install` before trying to run the application. 

When doing a search you will notice an activity indicator top right after a search has been performed.

Also, make sure to use `CMD + K` to enable the system keyboard to show up. 
The search only works by using the `Search` button in the bottom right of the keyboard.
